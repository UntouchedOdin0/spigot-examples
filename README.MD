# Spigot Examples

A set of example code showing how to do common tasks with the Spigot API.

These examples try to follow the best practices and convention whenever possible, 
however it should be noted that some package names have been given underscores for the sake of readability.

For example `me.bristermitten.spigotexamples.runtime_dependencies` is not a traditionally conventional package name
but is used to create a more readable name.

#Current Feature List
* [Custom Enchantments](/src/main/java/me/bristermitten/spigotexamples/custom_enchantment)
* [Runtime Dependencies](/src/main/java/me/bristermitten/spigotexamples/runtime_dependencies)
