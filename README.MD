# Spigot Examples

A set of example code showing how to do common tasks with the Spigot API. These are designed to be copy paste-able
with minimal adjustments.

### Design Principles
* All examples are in Java, but some have Kotlin equivalents included.
* This repository follows the Allman code style.
* PaperSpigot should be preferred over normal Spigot, as it has a richer API and features SLF4J, which this repository uses for logging.
* This also features a lightweight Reflection library, as many operations use Reflection. This can either be copied, or converted to normal Reflection.
* This repository always uses the latest Minecraft version that is stable.


# Current Feature List
* [Custom Enchantments](/src/main/java/me/bristermitten/spigotexamples/customenchantment)
* [Runtime Dependencies](/src/main/java/me/bristermitten/spigotexamples/runtimelibraries) - Downloading and loading in external jars at runtime.
* [Basic Reflection Library](/src/main/java/me/bristermitten/spigotexamples/reflect)
